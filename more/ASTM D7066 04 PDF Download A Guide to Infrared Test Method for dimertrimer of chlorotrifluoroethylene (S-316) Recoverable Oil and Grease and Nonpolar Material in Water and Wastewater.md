# How to Download ASTM D7066-04 PDF for Free
 
ASTM D7066-04 is a standard test method for dimer/trimer of chlorotrifluoroethylene (S-316) recoverable oil and grease and nonpolar material by infrared determination. This test method is used to measure the concentration of oil and grease in water samples, such as wastewater, industrial effluents, surface water, and groundwater.

ASTM D7066-04 is based on the principle of extracting oil and grease from a water sample using a solvent that is miscible with water and has a high infrared absorbance in the region of interest. The solvent is then evaporated and the residue is weighed and analyzed by an infrared spectrometer. The absorbance of the residue at a specific wavelength is proportional to the concentration of oil and grease in the sample.

This test method has several advantages over other methods for measuring oil and grease in water samples. For example, it does not require any filtration or centrifugation of the sample, which can cause loss or alteration of the analytes. It also does not require any calibration standards or blanks, as the absorbance of the solvent is subtracted from the absorbance of the residue. It also has a wide range of applicability, as it can measure both polar and nonpolar compounds in oil and grease.
 
However, ASTM D7066-04 also has some limitations and interferences that need to be considered. For instance, it may not be suitable for samples that contain volatile or semivolatile organic compounds, as they may evaporate during the extraction or drying process. It may also not be able to detect some compounds that have low infrared absorbance or that overlap with the solvent peak. Moreover, it may be affected by the presence of water-soluble organic compounds, suspended solids, or emulsified oil and grease in the sample.
