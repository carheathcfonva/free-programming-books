Here are some excerpts from the book that illustrate the main features of the Balance Method and the Acupuncture 1, 2, 3 approach:

> "The Balance Method is a system of acupuncture that balances the energy of the meridians in order to treat diseases. The basic principle is to use distal points that are located on the same meridian or on a meridian that is connected to the diseased area by the six divisions or the twelve regular meridians. The Balance Method does not use local points or symptomatic points, but rather focuses on the root cause of the imbalance."

> "The Five Systems of the Balance Method are five different ways of applying the Balance Method to various clinical situations. They are: (1) The Meridian Conversion System, which uses the image of the body on the hand or foot to treat any part of the body; (2) The Mirror Image System, which uses the image of the body on the opposite side or opposite end to treat any part of the body; (3) The Seasonal Balance System, which uses points that correspond to the seasons and the five elements to treat any part of the body; (4) The Numeric Balance System, which uses points that have numerical relationships to treat any part of the body; and (5) The Balance Logic System, which uses points that have logical relationships to treat any part of the body."

> "The Acupuncture 1, 2, 3 approach is a simple and effective way of applying the Five Systems of the Balance Method to any clinical complaint. The three steps are: (1) Identify the affected meridian(s) by using a simple method of diagnosis such as pulse, tongue, or symptom location; (2) Select one or two points from one of the Five Systems that balance the affected meridian(s); and (3) Needle the selected points with proper technique and stimulation."

By following these steps, practitioners can achieve remarkable results with minimal needles and maximal patient satisfaction. Acupuncture 1, 2, 3 is a book that will help practitioners master the art and science of acupuncture and enhance their clinical skills and confidence.
