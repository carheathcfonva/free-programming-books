Alternating current (AC) circuits are the backbone of modern electrical power systems. They allow the transmission and distribution of electricity over long distances and at different voltages. AC circuits also enable the use of transformers, motors, generators, and other devices that rely on changing magnetic fields.
 
One of the most comprehensive and authoritative textbooks on AC circuits is *Alternating Current Circuits* by Russell M. Kerchner and George F. Corcoran. First published in 1951, this book covers the theory and analysis of AC circuits in detail, with numerous examples and problems. The book also includes chapters on polyphase circuits, resonance, filters, power measurements, and network theorems.

The fourth edition of *Alternating Current Circuits*, published in 1980, is available as a free PDF download from the Internet Archive[^1^]. This edition has been revised and updated to reflect the latest developments in electrical engineering. It also contains a new appendix on complex numbers and phasors, which are essential tools for AC circuit analysis.
 
*Alternating Current Circuits* by Kerchner and Corcoran is a classic textbook that has been used by generations of electrical engineers and students. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about AC circuits and their applications.

## Applications of AC Circuits
 
AC circuits have many advantages and applications over DC circuits. Some of the main applications of AC circuits are:
 
- Power generation and transmission: AC circuits are used to generate and transmit electrical power over long distances with minimal losses. AC generators produce alternating voltages by rotating coils in magnetic fields. AC transformers can step up or step down the voltage levels for efficient transmission and distribution. AC power lines can carry high voltages and currents with low resistance and heating.
- Power conversion: AC circuits are used to convert AC power to DC power or vice versa using devices such as rectifiers, inverters, converters, and adapters. These devices are essential for many electronic devices and appliances that operate on different voltage and frequency levels.
- Electromagnetic induction: AC circuits are used to induce electric currents and voltages in conductors using changing magnetic fields. This phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction and it is the basis of many devices such as motors, generators, transformers, solenoids, relays, speakers, microphones, etc.
- Signal processing: AC circuits are used to process and manipulate signals such as audio, video, radio, etc. using devices such as filters, amplifiers, oscillators, modulators, demodulators, etc. These devices can alter the frequency, amplitude, phase, or shape of the signals for various purposes.
- Measurement and instrumentation: AC circuits are used to measure and monitor various physical quantities such as voltage, current, power, resistance, capacitance, inductance, impedance, etc. using devices such as meters, oscilloscopes, multimeters, bridges, etc. These devices can display or record the values of the quantities in different modes such as peak-to-peak, RMS, average, etc.

These are some of the common applications of AC circuits. There are many more applications that involve the use of AC circuits in various fields such as communication, engineering, medicine, entertainment, etc.
