Animate 2 is a powerful plugin for Daz Studio that allows you to create and edit animations with aniblocks. Aniblocks are pre-made animation clips that you can mix and match to create complex motions for your characters. With Animate 2, you can also adjust the timing, speed, and blending of aniblocks, as well as add keyframes and curves to fine-tune your animations.
 
However, to use Animate 2 in Daz Studio, you need a serial number that unlocks the full features of the plugin. The serial number is a 16-digit code that starts with SGFANMT. You can find it in your account page under "My Serial Numbers" if you have purchased Animate 2 from the Daz 3D store[^1^]. If you don't see it there, you may need to open a sales support ticket[^1^] [^2^] and provide your order number and email address.

Alternatively, you can also get Animate 2 for free if you purchase the aniMate2 Leisure Time Bundle for M4[^3^], which includes a collection of aniblocks for Michael 4. This bundle also comes with a serial number for Animate 2 that you can use in Daz Studio. However, this bundle may not be available in the store search, so you may need to use this link[^3^] or search for it in your favorite search engine[^4^].
 
Once you have your serial number, you can enter it in Daz Studio by going to Help > About Installed Plugins > aniMate 2 > Register. This will activate Animate 2 and let you enjoy its full functionality. You can then start creating amazing animations for your characters with ease and fun.

## How to Use Animate 2 in Daz Studio
 
Now that you have your serial number for Animate 2, you may wonder how to use it in Daz Studio. In this section, we will show you some basic steps and tips to create and edit animations with Animate 2.
 
1. Load a character in Daz Studio. You can use any figure that is compatible with Animate 2, such as Genesis, Genesis 2, Genesis 3, Genesis 8, Victoria 4, Michael 4, etc.
2. Open the aniMate tab by going to Window > Tabs > aniMate. You will see a timeline with tracks for your character and a library of aniblocks that you can use.
3. Drag and drop an aniblock from the library to the track of your character. You can hover your mouse over an aniblock to preview it on your character before dropping it. You can also use the search bar to find an aniblock by name or category.
4. Adjust the position, length, and speed of the aniblock by using the handles on the edges or corners. You can also right-click on the aniblock to access more options, such as loop, split, trim, reverse, etc.
5. Add more aniblocks to your track to create a longer animation. Animate 2 will automatically blend the transitions between aniblocks to make them smooth and natural. You can also adjust the blending by using the handles on the sides of the aniblocks.
6. If you want to edit an aniblock in more detail, you can enter the keyframe mode by double-clicking on it. This will open a new track with keyframes and curves that represent the motion of your character. You can add, delete, or move keyframes and curves to change the animation. You can also use the graph editor to visualize and adjust the keyframes and curves in a separate window.
7. If you want to add more tracks for your character, such as for expressions or poses, you can use the subtracks feature. Subtracks are layers that allow you to overlay different types of aniblocks over your main track. For example, you can add a subtrack for morph expression aniblocks to make your character smile or frown while walking or running. You can also add a subtrack for pose aniblocks to change the entire poise of your character.
8. If you want to animate multiple objects or characters in your scene, you can add more tracks for them in the aniMate tab. You can drag and drop aniblocks for each object or character and adjust them as you wish. You can also use the parent constraint feature to make one object follow another object's motion. For example, you can make your character pick up a sword and drop it later.
9. If you want to add audio to your animation, you can use the audio aniblocks feature. Audio aniblocks are sound clips that you can drag and drop to your track and sync them with your animation. You can use audio aniblocks for dialogue, music, sound effects, etc.
10. If you want to export your animation to another software or format, you can use the export feature in Animate 2. You can export your animation as a BVH file, a MDD file, or a DAZ Studio script file. You can also bake your animation to the Daz Studio timeline for more editing options.

These are some of the basic steps and tips to use Animate 2 in Daz Studio. Of course, there are more features and options that you can explore and experiment with in Animate 2. For more information and tutorials on Animate 2, you can check out this video or this product.
