## Who is Fariduddin Attar?
  
Fariduddin Attar (c. 1145 - c. 1221) was a Persian poet and mystic who is regarded as one of the greatest figures of classical Persian literature and Sufism. His name Attar means \"the perfumer\", as he was originally a pharmacist and perfumer by profession. He later abandoned his worldly career and devoted himself to writing poetry and prose on spiritual themes.
  
Attar is best known for his epic poem Mantiq al-Tayr (The Conference of the Birds), which is an allegorical journey of 30 birds in search of their king, the Simurgh. The poem is a masterpiece of symbolism and imagery that explores the various aspects of Sufi doctrine and practice. Attar also wrote other famous works such as Asrar-Nama (The Book of Secrets), Ilahi-Nama (The Book of Divine), Mosibat-Nama (The Book of Adversity), Elahi-Nama (The Book of God), and Divan (The Collected Poems).
  
Attar was influenced by many Sufi masters and poets, such as Abu Sa'id Abul-Khayr, Ahmad Ghazali, Sanai, Rumi, and Nizami. He also met many Sufi saints in person and recorded their stories in his Tazkiratul Awliya. He was a contemporary of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishti order of Sufism in India. Attar died in his hometown Nishapur during the Mongol invasion.
