## Image Processing
  
Another feature of Ergosoft TexPrint that can enhance your textile printing quality is image processing. This feature allows you to edit and optimize your images before printing, using tools such as cropping, resizing, rotating, mirroring, sharpening, smoothing, and color correction.
