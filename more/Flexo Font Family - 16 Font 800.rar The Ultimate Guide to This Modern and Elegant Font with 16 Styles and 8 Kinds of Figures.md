However, unlike these fonts, Flexo has softer curves and more humanistic proportions. It also avoids the optical flaws and monotony of some geometric fonts by using subtle variations in stroke width, x-height, and letter spacing. Flexo is a balanced and harmonious typeface that respects the tradition of geometric sans serif while adding a contemporary touch.

One of the distinctive features of Flexo Font Family is its use of stylistic alternates. These are alternate glyphs that can be accessed through OpenType features or by using different font files. Flexo offers four sets of stylistic alternates for the uppercase letters: A, E, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, S, U, W, and Y. These alternates can create different effects and moods in your text, depending on your preference and context. For example, you can use the alternate A with a crossbar to create a more geometric look, or the alternate S with a curved spine to create a more dynamic look.
 
Another feature of Flexo Font Family is its support for eight different kinds of figures: lining proportional, lining tabular, oldstyle proportional, oldstyle tabular, superior, inferior, numerator, and denominator. These figures can be used for various purposes, such as dates, fractions, percentages, footnotes, references, and more. Flexo also supports fractions and ordinals through OpenType features. You can easily create any fraction or ordinal number with Flexo by using a slash or a period between the numbers.
