The novel is divided into four parts, each focusing on a different aspect of the nuclear conspiracy. The first part, titled "Kante", introduces the main characters and the background of Pakistan's nuclear program. It also reveals how Dr. Khan and his associates started to smuggle nuclear components and technology to other countries, such as Iran, Libya, and North Korea. The second part, titled "Kahuta", shows how Asad and Zara begin to investigate the nuclear network and discover its links to various militant groups, such as the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. They also encounter a mysterious agent named Ali, who claims to be working for the ISI, Pakistan's intelligence agency. The third part, titled "Kabul", follows Asad and Zara as they travel to Afghanistan to find more evidence of the nuclear conspiracy. They face many dangers and obstacles along the way, including a deadly ambush by the Taliban and a kidnapping by a rogue ISI officer. The fourth and final part, titled "Khatam", brings the novel to a climax as Asad and Zara try to stop a nuclear attack on Dubai that could trigger a global war. They also have to confront Dr. Khan and his mastermind, who turns out to be someone they never expected.

The novel does not reveal the identity of the mastermind behind the nuclear conspiracy until the very end. It is a shocking twist that surprises both the readers and the characters. The mastermind is none other than General Zia-ul-Haq, the former president of Pakistan who died in a plane crash in 1988. The novel reveals that Zia faked his death and went into hiding, where he continued to oversee the nuclear network and plot his revenge against the world. He planned to use the nuclear attack on Dubai as a way to destabilize the Middle East and provoke a war between the US and Iran. He also wanted to destroy Pakistan's democracy and restore his dictatorship.
 
Asad and Zara manage to stop the nuclear attack with the help of Ali, who turns out to be a double agent working for the CIA. They infiltrate the cargo ship that is carrying the nuclear device and disable it before it reaches Dubai. They also alert the authorities and expose the nuclear network to the public. They face a final confrontation with Zia and his loyalists on the ship, where they manage to kill him and end his reign of terror.
