Fortunately, there is a way to run Microsoft Office 2000 on a USB drive without installing it on your computer. This can be useful if you need to use Office 2000 on different computers or if you want to have a backup copy of your files and settings. Here are the steps to create a portable version of Microsoft Office 2000:
 
1. Download a portable app launcher such as [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/) Platform and install it on your USB drive.
2. Download the Microsoft Office 2000 Developer Tools from [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-office/2000) and extract the files to a folder on your USB drive.
3. Run the Setup.exe file from the folder and follow the instructions to install Microsoft Office 2000 Developer on your USB drive. Choose Custom installation and deselect any components that you don't need.
4. Run the PortableApps.com Platform from your USB drive and click on the Options button. Go to Advanced and check the box for "Show hidden files and folders".
5. Navigate to the folder where you installed Microsoft Office 2000 Developer on your USB drive and find the file named MSO9.DLL. Copy this file and paste it in the same folder as the PortableApps.com Platform.
6. Rename the MSO9.DLL file to MSO.DLL.
7. Create a new folder on your USB drive and name it "Microsoft Office 2000". Inside this folder, create subfolders for each Office application that you want to use, such as "Word", "Excel", "PowerPoint", etc.
8. Navigate to the folder where you installed Microsoft Office 2000 Developer on your USB drive and find the executable files for each Office application that you want to use, such as WINWORD.EXE, EXCEL.EXE, POWERPNT.EXE, etc. Copy these files and paste them in the corresponding subfolders that you created in step 7.
9. Create shortcuts for each Office application that you want to use on your USB drive. You can do this by right-clicking on the executable files and choosing "Create Shortcut". Rename the shortcuts as you like and move them to the root folder of your USB drive or to the PortableApps.com Platform menu.
10. You can now run Microsoft Office 2000 from your USB drive by double-clicking on the shortcuts or by launching them from the PortableApps.com Platform menu. You can also customize the settings and preferences of each Office application as you normally would.

Note: This method may not work with some newer computers or operating systems. It may also violate the license agreement of Microsoft Office 2000. Use it at your own risk.
