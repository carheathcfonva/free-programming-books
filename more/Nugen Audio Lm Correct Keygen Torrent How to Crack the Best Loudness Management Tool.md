## What is NuGen Audio LMCorrect?
  
NuGen Audio LMCorrect is a software that provides an automatic and hassle-free route to loudness-compliant audio. It can handle audio files from mono to 7.1.2 channels, and it supports all current loudness standards, such as EBU R128, ITU-R BS.1770, ATSC A/85, OP-59, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, and more.
  
LMCorrect can measure and correct your audio faster than real-time, using a unique look-ahead True Peak limiter that prevents potential compliance failure due to loudness correction. It can also transform your audio from one specification to another with a single click, without the need to manually repurpose in your editor.
  
With the optional DynApt extension, LMCorrect can also adjust the LRA and dynamics of your audio, while preserving dialog intelligibility and respecting intentional dramatic transitions. This is especially useful for adapting your audio for different platforms and devices.
