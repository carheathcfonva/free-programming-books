- Not all arcade games are compatible with MAME ELF. Some may not run at all, some may have graphical or sound glitches, and some may run too slow or too fast. You can check the compatibility list [here](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/mame-elf-compatibility-list.31371/) for more information.
- If you have a lot of ROMs, it may take a while for MAME ELF to scan them and display them on the menu. You can speed up this process by creating a file called "gamelist.txt" in the "MAME" folder and listing the names of the ROMs you want to show up (one per line).
- You can adjust various settings for MAME ELF by pressing Triangle on the menu. You can change the video mode, the controller mapping, the sound volume, and more.
- You can also access a cheat menu by pressing Square on the menu. You can enable cheats for some games, such as infinite lives, invincibility, etc.
- If you encounter any problems with MAME ELF, you can report them on the official [forum thread](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/mame-elf-for-ps2-by-sp193.1028/). The developer may be able to fix them in future updates.
