- EMP: This is an electromagnetic pulse that can disable the electronics of nearby vehicles, making them unable to steer or accelerate.
- Oil Cannon: This is a device that can spray oil on the road behind you, creating a slippery surface that can make other cars skid and crash.
- Rocket Launcher: This is a weapon that can fire rockets at your target, causing massive damage and explosions.
- Machine Gun: This is a weapon that can shoot bullets at your target, damaging their car and reducing their health.
