The Powertrain System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT) software is a tool that enables engineers to evaluate and optimize the design and performance of hybrid electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. PSAT was developed by Argonne National Laboratory in collaboration with leading automakers and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. PSAT can simulate the transient behavior and control system characteristics of various powertrain configurations under different driving cycles and scenarios. In this article, we will show you how to download and use PSAT to model and analyze advanced vehicle powertrains.
 
## How to Download PSAT
 
PSAT is available for download from the Argonne National Laboratory website[^1^]. You will need to register and agree to the terms and conditions before you can access the download link. PSAT requires MATLABÂ® and SimulinkÂ® software from MathWorks to run. You can also download a free trial version of MATLAB and Simulink from the MathWorks website[^1^]. After downloading PSAT, you will need to install it on your computer following the instructions provided in the user manual.

## How to Use PSAT
 
PSAT consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) and a library of powertrain components that can be assembled into different vehicle models using Simulink. PSAT also provides a set of predefined vehicle models that cover a range of technologies, such as conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell, and electric vehicles. You can use these models as a starting point or create your own custom models by adding or modifying components.
 
To use PSAT, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Launch PSAT from MATLAB by typing `psat` in the command window.
2. Select a vehicle model from the list or create a new one using the `New` button.
3. Edit the vehicle parameters, such as mass, drag coefficient, tire radius, etc., using the `Edit` button.
4. Edit the powertrain components, such as engine, motor, battery, transmission, etc., using the `Edit` button.
5. Select a driving cycle from the list or create a new one using the `New` button.
6. Run the simulation using the `Run` button.
7. View the simulation results, such as fuel economy, emissions, energy consumption, etc., using the `Results` button.
8. Compare different vehicle models or scenarios using the `Compare` button.
9. Export the simulation results to Excel or MATLAB using the `Export` button.

For more details on how to use PSAT, you can refer to the user manual or watch the video tutorials available on the Argonne National Laboratory website[^1^].
 
## Conclusion
 
PSAT is a powerful and flexible tool that can help engineers design and optimize advanced vehicle powertrains. PSAT can simulate hundreds of vehicle configurations and evaluate their fuel economy and performance under different driving conditions. PSAT is easy to use and can be downloaded for free from the Argonne National Laboratory website. If you are interested in modeling and analyzing hybrid electric, fuel cell, or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, you should give PSAT a try.
