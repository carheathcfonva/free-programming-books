- Rey Mysterio shocked the world by defeating JBL in just 21 seconds to win the Intercontinental Championship, ending JBL's career in the process. Mysterio wore a Joker-inspired mask and attire, while JBL delivered a scathing promo before the match, claiming he was a wrestling god.
- The Extreme Rules Match between Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy was a brutal and emotional showdown between the estranged brothers, who used chairs, tables, ladders, and even a flaming table to inflict pain on each other. Matt Hardy emerged victorious after hitting Jeff with a Twist of Fate on a steel chair.
- The 25-Diva Battle Royal for the title of "Miss WrestleMania" was a surprise-filled and hilarious affair, with Divas from the past and present competing for the honor. The match ended with Santino Marella, disguised as his twin sister "Santina", eliminating Beth Phoenix and Melina to win the crown.
- Chris Jericho faced off against three WWE legends: Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, Roddy Piper, and Jimmy Snuka, with Ric Flair in their corner. Jericho managed to defeat all three legends, but was then confronted by another legend: Mickey Rourke, who knocked him out with a punch.
- The World Heavyweight Championship Triple Threat Match between John Cena, Edge, and Big Show was a power-packed clash of titans, with each superstar trying to overcome the odds. Cena pulled off an incredible feat by lifting both Edge and Big Show on his shoulders and delivering a double Attitude Adjustment to win the title.
- The main event between WWE Champion Triple H and Randy Orton was a personal and intense grudge match, with Orton having attacked Triple H's family in the weeks leading up to WrestleMania. The stipulation was that if Triple H got disqualified or counted out, he would lose the title.
