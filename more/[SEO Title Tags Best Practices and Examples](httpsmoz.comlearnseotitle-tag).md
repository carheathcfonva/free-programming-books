Years later, Kunal (Bobby Deol) grows up to be a rebellious young man who has no interest in joining the army. He wants to settle abroad and make money. His grandfather Amarjeet is disappointed with him and tries to persuade him to change his mind. He also reveals to him that Shweta was not his real mother, but his stepmother. His real mother was Aarti (Nagma), who was married to Major Rajeev Singh (Akshay Kumar), an army officer who went missing on his wedding day.
 
Kunal is shocked to learn this and decides to join the army to find out more about his father. He is posted at the Indo-Pak border, where he meets Shweta again, who is now a journalist. He also encounters Rajeev, who is alive but working as a spy for Pakistan under the name of Ashfaque Khan (Danny Denzongpa). Rajeev has been brainwashed by Maqsood Bhat (Govind Namdeo), a terrorist leader who wants to destroy India.
