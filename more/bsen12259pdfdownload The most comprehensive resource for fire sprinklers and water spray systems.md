# BS EN 12259: Fixed Firefighting Systems Components for Sprinkler and Water Spray Systems
 
BS EN 12259 is a series of standards that specify the requirements for construction and performance of components used in fixed firefighting systems for sprinkler and water spray systems. These components include wet alarm valve assemblies, dry alarm valve assemblies, water motor alarms, and other devices that are essential for the proper functioning of automatic sprinkler systems.

The standards aim to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the components in case of fire, as well as their compatibility with other parts of the system. The standards also provide methods for testing and approval of the components, as well as marking and documentation requirements.
 
The standards are intended for use by manufacturers, designers, installers, inspectors, and users of fixed firefighting systems for sprinkler and water spray systems. They are also relevant for authorities having jurisdiction, fire brigades, insurance companies, and other stakeholders involved in fire safety.
